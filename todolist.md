- [ ] Watching vedio about PINN
- [ ] Learning about the pertubation theroy for Many-Body problem
- [ ] Prepare for QE
- [ ] Finish the draft of the paper
    - [ ] NTO or electron-hole?

- [ ] The paper remains to be read
    - [x] The unique properties of superatoms([collective dipole oscillations](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.1805), izonization energy, etc.) 

    - [ ] [The electronic shell structure of superatoms.](10.1103/PhysRevLett.65.748)

- [ ] Calculate the spin structure of Au8Pt5
    -[ ] For vasp: magnetization, the spin multiplicity equals to magnetization + 1.
    -[ ] For Gaussian: the spin multiplicity must be set before the calculation, so I should calculate the single point energies for Au8Pt5 with different spin multiplicity.

- [ ] Conduct some research on how to characterize which electrons in the atoms that make up the molecular composition participate in the formation of molecular orbitals and which ones remain in the inner layers.
    - [ ] Atoms in molecules, AIM theory
