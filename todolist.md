- [ ] Watching vedio about PINN
- [ ] Learning about the pertubation theroy for Many-Body problem
- [ ] Prepare for QE
- [x] Finish the draft of the paper
    - [ ] NTO or electron-hole?

- [ ] The paper remains to be read
    - [x] The unique properties of superatoms([collective dipole oscillations](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.1805), izonization energy, etc.) 

    - [x] [The electronic shell structure of superatoms.](10.1103/PhysRevLett.65.748)

- [ ] Calculate the spin structure of Au8Pt5
    - [ ] For vasp: magnetization, the spin multiplicity equals to magnetization + 1.
    - [ ] For Gaussian: the spin multiplicity must be set before the calculation, so I should calculate the single point energies for Au8Pt5 with different spin multiplicity.

- [ ] Conduct some research on how to characterize which electrons in the atoms that make up the molecular composition participate in the formation of molecular orbitals and which ones remain in the inner layers.
    - [ ] Atoms in molecules, AIM theory

- [ ] read papers about Pt Cd in Au13
    - [ ] [Stoichiometric Formation of Open-Shell](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.9b06254)
    - [ ] [Synergistic Effects of Pt and Cd Codoping to Icosahedral Au13 Superatoms](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c06765)
    - [x] [d10 - d10 in Pt](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00475a017)

- [ ] Jahnâˆ’Teller effect, in book Physics and Chemistry of Small Clusters, may connect with the geometric distortion to break the symmetry of the non-linear molecular with degenerate states.??

- [ ] Read papers related with magnetic properties of metal cluster, especially for transition metal. It seems that some host metal atoms, like alkali metal, could stablize the magnetic moment of the transition metal impurities, to create magnetic moment even higher than the free atom.
    - [x] [Impurities retain their magnetic moment](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.253401)
    - [ ] [Odd-even effects](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.71.155412)
    - [ ] [Theortical study of the magnetic properties of small transition metal clusters](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.67.094424)

- [ ] Some paper about calculating embedding energy of cluster with impurity:
    - [ ] [Nearly-free-electron gas in a silicon cage](https://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevB.72.165413)
    - [ ] Wigner-witmer spin conservation

- [ ] Some paper about Au-M+ alloy
    - [ ] [Theoretical study of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of AumM+ cluster](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.71.155412)
    - [x] [Transition metal at Au12 cage](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.83.155404)

    - [ ] [The relationship between SOS and two level model](http://sobereva.com/361) 
    - [ ] [two/three level model practice](http://sobereva.com/512)
