## Basic pictures in Schrödinger equation

Schrödinger equation could be written as follows:

$$ i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\vec{r}, t) = \hat{H} \Psi(\vec{r},t), \ \hat{H} = \frac{\vec{\hat{p}}^2}{2m} + V(\vec{r}), \  \vec{\hat{p}} = - \frac{i}{\hbar} \nabla, $$

And the stationary Schrödinger equation is:

$$ \hat{H} \Phi(\vec{r}) = E_{n} \Phi_{n}(\vec{r}), $$

Where $$ \Psi(\vec{r}, t) = \sum_{n} \exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} E_{n}) \phi_{n}(\vec{r})$$, and the operators are all time-indenpendent, it's called Schrödinger picture. The transition matrix elements are given as:

$$ O_{mn} = \langle $$


### Heisenberg picture

In Heisenberg picture, the operators are time-dependent, and the wave function is time-independent.

### Interaction picture
