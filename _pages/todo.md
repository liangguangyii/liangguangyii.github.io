- [ ] Read the book "Quantum Theory of Radiation"

- [ ] Hyper Ramnathan effect and NLO.

- [ ] vibrational dynamic dipole polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities. J. Chem. Phys., 108,10013(1998) and D.M. Bishop, Molecular vibration and nonlinear optics,Adv. Chem. Phys., 104, 1-40(1998)

- [ ] tuned range-separated functional
    - [x] Why all examples are neutral? How about the charged cluster?
    - [x] More orbitals (not only HOMO-LUMO) should be tuned in transition metals, maybe by TDDFT we could choose some important orbitals to tune.**Though I still don't know the rules to choose these orbits.**
    - [ ] There are three ways to prove the resulted are reliable:
        - [ ] Compare the static hyperpolarization tensor for tuned LC-wPBE and MP2, cause MP2 lack out analytical derivative higher than 2-order.
        - [x] Compare the result of LC-wPBE with experimental data of some small transition cluster.**LC-wPBE does not has the 3-order analytical derivative in Gaussian. So we could not calculate the dynamic hyperpolarization.**
        - [x] Or use LC-PBE0 (with two parameter $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$), to optimize.
    - [x] for Au4(2e), with CCSD as reference, I find CAM-B3lyp is much better than tuned LC-wPBE, though Gaussian doesn't support the 3-order analytic derivative of LC-wPBE. So maybe we could tune CAM-B3LYP?**Au4(2e) dose not have obvious dipole as the result of its high symmetry, so beta|| is meaningless, try to use other small cluster with lower symmetry.**
        - [x] For CAM-B3LYP, which is different form other functional, which does not contain 100% HF exchange terms in far distance, that makes the result of beta close to CCSD (That also works for LC-PBE0 if I turn HF proportion of far distance less than 1). However, it performs worse in J2 J fucntion.
    - [x] MP2 is worse in Au4(2e).
    - [x] wb97x! and we don't need DFT-D3, because it's vertical excitation energy, not the adiabatic excitation energy. It has similar performance with CAM-B3LYP, when no tuning. And it also has the 3-order analytic derivative.
    - [ ] CCSD and CCSD(T) is NOT the golden standard for the case when static correlation is important, try to use FCI or CASSCF.
    - [x] Is it necessary to use [fragment scf initial guess](http://sobereva.com/82) for the transition metal cluster? And how to choose the fragment? **No, because fragment inital guess could only set the integer spin, however in transition metal cluster, it's more complex.**
    - [ ] Find some works about the Non Linear Optical properties of transition metal cluster, especially for the hyperpolarizability.
    - [ ] Only in the region around equilibrium could we use the single dominant configuration, other times we should use the multi-configuration. So as to the calculation of hyperpolarizability.
    - [x] I have calculated the density matrix of CCSD, so maybe I could use it to evaluate the degree of static correlation in the transition metal cluster. **T1 diag has finished, 0.05>0.02, I am trying to use Full electron CCSD.**
    - [ ] For system with high static correlation, we should use functional with lower HF proportion. (wb97xd is too high - 1.22036 in short range and 0.777964 in long range, try to use wb97x - about 0.15 in short range.)
        - [ ] Maybe we could try to use pure DFT functional, like PBE, r2SCAN, TPSS, MN15L.
        - [ ] And Dose these functional have range-separated form? Now I have already known that there exist LC-TPSS.
    - [ ] The functional with higher HF proportion performs well in untuned case, compared with CCSD result. However, it may be the error cancellation, maybe they perform worse in **dynamic hyperpolarization.**
    - [ ] All spin multiplicity of the cluster is calculated in CCSD level, to let the fine tuning result more close to the CCSD result.

    - [ ] Try CAM-B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP* and LC-TPss, LC-TPssh.
        - [ ] LC-TPSSh, where https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theochem.2009.01.018 suggests that the HF proportion should be smaller than 10% in Ni2O2.
        - [ ] Use TPSS2TPSS defined in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theochem.2009.01.018, because HF proportion of TPSSh is too high that even if I tuned w the dynamic hyperpolarization is still bad.

    - [ ] Superatoms all have degenerate HOMO-LUMO orbits, should we use Multireference method to calculate them instead? (by performing a correlation analysis of T1 D1 %TAE(T) with C0 -> the golden rule, as see in 0.1021/acs.jctc.5b00861).

    - [ ] DR < 1.5 $$\rightarrow$$ Warning? read the relative paper about the limit of DR and dipole. [Reference molecules for nonlinear optics: A joint
experimental and theoretical investigation], actually, it reports the case that DR < 1.5.
