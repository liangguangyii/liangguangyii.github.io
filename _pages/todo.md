- [ ] Watching vedio about PINN
- [ ] Learning about the pertubation theroy for Many-Body problem
- [x] Prepare for QE
- [x] Finish the draft of the paper
    - [ ] NTO or electron-hole?

- [ ] The paper remains to be read

- [x] Calculate the spin structure of Au8Pt5
    - [x] For vasp: magnetization, the spin multiplicity equals to magnetization + 1.
    - [x] For Gaussian: the spin multiplicity must be set before the calculation, so I should calculate the single point energies for Au8Pt5 with different spin multiplicity.
